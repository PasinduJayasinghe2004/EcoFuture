                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p>The webpage is built using a structured HTML5 approach with semantic elements organizing content into a logical hierarchy.
                        This HTML page is a structured, educational website focused on climate change and biodiversity. 
                        It uses semantic HTML5 elements like <b>header</b>, <b>section</b>, and <b>footer</b>, with a responsive layout supported by external CSS files.
                             The navigation bar links to various related pages, while the main content includes images, tables, and ordered lists that explain the impacts of climate change and offer practical solutions. 
                             The <b>strong</b> tag is used to emphasize key points, enhancing accessibility and clarity. Although the design is informative and accessible, there are some minor issues like spelling errors and missing link paths that could be improved for better usability and accuracy.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>
                        The site has good basic accessibility features, such as semantic HTML elements <b>header, nav, section, footer</b> and the use of <b>strong</b> for important text, which helps screen readers emphasize key messages. The layout is responsive, making it mobile-friendly.
                             However, some accessibility issues exist, such as spelling errors, missing alt text in some places, and empty or incomplete navigation links, which could confuse users with screen readers or impairments. Improving these areas would enhance overall accessibility and user experience.

                <h2 id="challenge">Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>During the development of a website using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I faced several challenges common to beginners. 
                    Structuring the layout was difficult, as elements often appeared misaligned or cluttered, which I resolved by learning CSS Flexbox and Grid
                    And the other challenge was creating a sitemap.It was very difficult to look and change the value.
                    However through out these kind of challenges,I Learned important lessons.How to plan a websie before code and also how to solve layout issues.
                    The whole coursework is a great lesson for me because now I have a great Knowledge how to plan a website before code it.
